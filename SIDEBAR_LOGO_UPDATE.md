# Sidebar Header Logo Update

## Changes Made
- Removed "LI COUNCIL" text from sidebar header
- Updated sidebar to display only the logo image
- Used existing `/img/logo.png` file for both desktop and mobile sidebar
- Logo scales appropriately when sidebar is collapsed (h-6) vs expanded (h-8)

## Logo Specifications
- **Current Logo**: `/public/img/logo.png` (square format)
- **Recommended Wide Logo**: Create `/public/img/logo-wide.png` for better horizontal display
- **Mobile Sidebar**: Logo height 32px (h-8)
- **Desktop Sidebar**: 
  - Expanded: Logo height 32px (h-8)
  - Collapsed: Logo height 24px (h-6)

## Implementation Details
- Logo uses `w-auto` to maintain aspect ratio
- Logo uses `object-contain` to fit within bounds without distortion
- Smooth transitions when sidebar collapses/expands
- Consistent styling across mobile and desktop views

## Future Enhancements
To optimize the header appearance, consider:
1. Creating a wide logo version (`logo-wide.png`) that works better in horizontal layout
2. Using different logo variants for collapsed vs expanded states
3. Adding hover effects or subtle animations

## Files Modified
- `resources/js/components/layout/Sidebar.jsx`
