# Dialog Background Fix - UserManagement Component

## Issue Fixed
The dialog backgrounds in the UserManagement component were using a blur/semi-transparent background that made the content difficult to read and had poor visibility.

## Solution Applied
Updated all dialog components in UserManagement to use solid white backgrounds with proper styling for better visibility and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. State Assignment Dialog
```jsx
// Before
<DialogContent className="max-w-md">

// After  
<DialogContent className="max-w-md bg-white border border-gray-200 shadow-xl">
```

### 2. Role Management Dialog
```jsx
// Before
<DialogContent className="max-w-md">

// After
<DialogContent className="max-w-md bg-white border border-gray-200 shadow-xl">
```

### 3. Permission Management Dialog
```jsx
// Before
<DialogContent className="max-w-lg">

// After
<DialogContent className="max-w-lg bg-white border border-gray-200 shadow-xl">
```

### 4. Delete Confirmation Dialog
```jsx
// Before
<DialogContent className="max-w-md">

// After
<DialogContent className="max-w-md bg-white border border-gray-200 shadow-xl">
```
