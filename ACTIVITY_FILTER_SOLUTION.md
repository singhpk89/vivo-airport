# Activity Filter Issue - Solution

## Problem
The "All Activity" page is only showing approved activities instead of all activities.

## Root Cause
The user is currently on the **"Approved Activity"** page (`/reports/approved-activity`) instead of the **"All Activity"** page (`/reports/all-activity`).

The system has different routes for different activity statuses:
- `/reports/all-activity` - Shows ALL activities (pending, approved, rejected)
- `/reports/pending-activity` - Shows ONLY pending activities
- `/reports/approved-activity` - Shows ONLY approved activities  
- `/reports/rejected-activity` - Shows ONLY rejected activities

## Solution

### Option 1: Navigate to the Correct Page (Immediate Fix)
1. Look at the left sidebar
2. Under "Reports" section, click on **"All Activity"** (not "Approved Activity")
3. This will take you to `/reports/all-activity` which shows all activities regardless of status

### Option 2: Use the Status Filter
If you're already on the "All Activity" page and want to see all statuses:
1. Look for the Status filter dropdown
2. Select "All" from the status dropdown
3. Click "Apply Filters" if needed

## Current Page Status
Based on the route detection logic, if you're seeing only approved activities, you're likely on:
- **Current Page**: "Approved Activity" (`/reports/approved-activity`)
- **Correct Page**: "All Activity" (`/reports/all-activity`)

## Verification
To verify you're on the correct page:
1. Check the browser URL - it should show `/reports/all-activity`
2. Check the page title - it should show "All Activity" 
3. The status filter should be set to "All" by default

## Status Filter Behavior
- On `/reports/all-activity`: Status filter defaults to "All" and can be changed
- On `/reports/approved-activity`: Status filter is locked to "Approved" and cannot be changed
- On `/reports/pending-activity`: Status filter is locked to "Pending" and cannot be changed
- On `/reports/rejected-activity`: Status filter is locked to "Rejected" and cannot be changed
